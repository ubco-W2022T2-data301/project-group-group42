# Project Vision

## Group 42: Rona, Njabulo, and Aidan
Our goal is to have a clear interpretation about the environmental changes over time as a consequence of the climate crises. We hope to display this data to other students so we can understand when, where and what has caused the crises to progress to this state, collectively.
## Contracted Grade

For this project, we agree to contract for an A.
