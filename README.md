## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Looking at the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and amount of emmisions (with taking population in mind), our topic essentially is a curiosity around the climate crises.
We are interested in finding the relationship between GDP per capita and their relations to emmsions. From 1960's to 2016, we noticed a big change in climate overtime, yet increasing drastically over recent times. We are interested in finding out which country is impacted the most negatively by global emmisions. From previous research, the countries producing the least amount of emmisions are currently suffering the most from the climate crises. We are interested in determining why, what the correlation is, and how the statistics have changed over roughly 60 years.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our main dataset that we will be using is the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions provided by the Our World in Data organisation which is a registered charity in England and Wales. This data presents the global emissions produced from as early as the 1850's however, for this project we will be focusing on the 1960's to 2021 (roughly). This particular dataset was produced for education and we have the permission to use it as per the open license stated on the website. As to how this data was collected, with no doubt there was a large team involved to gather all this data, yet we only could only research the authors: Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser as the contributers who put this together. We will use this dataset along with other open licensed datasets involving rising: temperatures, natural disastors and gross domestic product, to fully understand the contribution and relationship each one has to the rising emission rates.
